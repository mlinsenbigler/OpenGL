**How do I approach designing software?**

I approach designing software with the intentions on delivering the highest quality code I am capable of. I'm always looking for better and more efficient ways to accomplish tasks through coding. This way, I gain valuable experience with every program and code module I work on. Building understanding and experience to produce a quality program is a good way to summarize my approach.

**What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**

This project has helped me learn how to create, place, texturize and light objects in a 3D space. It has also helped me to accomplish the creation of a virtual camera system that can be moved around the environment by user input controls such as a keyboard and a mouse.

**What design process did you follow for your project work?**

My design process was one of adding small changes to the scene each week. I would learn a new skill through instruction and then apply that skill to my scene to help make it more realistic.

**How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**

The idea of iteration is a great way of accomplishing large tasks or projects that have many deliverables. Being able to create a small part of the program and continually add to it is a good way to not get overwhelmed and trying to do too much at one time. This can be applied to any future task that is large in scope or has many complex parts.

**How do I approach developing programs?**

I approach developing programs by first gathering as much information as I can about what is expected and what direction I need to move and think in. Then I focus on producing a good foundation of the program that functions at a basic level. From there, I move into trying to add features and convenience functionality to try and meet all of the requirements set forth at the program's outset.

**What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**

While working on my 3D scene, I had to change a lot of the instructional code that we learned new skills with. Taking a certain format of code and changing it to fit the algorithms and data structures I was using for my 3D scene was difficult. I also had to try many different variations before I would find a working method or function.

**How did iteration factor into your development?**

Iteration was a huge factor in the development of this project. The knowledge we needed to accomplish the final deliverable was given out over a number of weeks, so we had to slowly add those elements to the final project scene as we gained the experience and information to do so. Each week the scene was iterated upon until the final product was created.

**How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**

The form and structure of the completed project started out very differently. Through the milestones, I had to migrate large parts of code into new structures and functions in order to add the new functionality requirements. My approach to development of the scene began to be determining what parts needed changed and what was the most efficient way of doing so to change the scene as needed.

**How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**

Computer science is teaching me very valuable problem solving skills and alternate methods of thinking to work through complex situations. It is also showing me there are multiple ways to complete an objective and the most efficient way usually comes down to some level of detail in the program's requirements. These are skills and ideas that can be applied to reaching any goal I have personally or professionally.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**

Computational graphics and visualization has made me rely on many different sources to accomplish the tasks each week. It has showed me that sometimes an assignment needs to be approached from a few different angles to end up coming together in the end.

**How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**

The course has helped me gain skills in perserverance, research and asking for help. These are things that I can apply to my professional pathway in the future. Asking for help isn't bad and can ultimately lead you to a result that meets all of the needs of those involved.
